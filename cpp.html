<p class="title">ps5 Engine and game mechanics</p>
    <p class="pc">
      As My big final year project a t university I made a game engine for the ps5 devkit, 
      which I later implemented light,collisions and gameplay mechanics into the game such 
      as certain interactions, if given the oppourtunity I would love to work more on this
      project. Working further on this project would be exceedingly hard as I do not own a ps5 dev kit.

    <p class="title">Basic Shoot 'em up template</p>
    <p class="ps">
      This video is a shoot 'em up template that i made in C++ using directx 11
      rendering 3d images with textures into the start and game over menus,I
      also use a 2d ship with a paralax scrolling background in the main game.

    <p class="title">Software hardware optimisation</p>
    <p class="grapple">
      This video shows two examples of software hardware optimisation skills in
      two different games, the first of which "Dino Tiles" was mainly optimised
      by switching to a data oriented design and monitoring the code quality, a
      good example of this is changing data types from doubles to floats when
      floats are not necessary. In the 2nd game which just shows particles
      moving across a screen was mainly optimised using threads, although other
      methods I used include passing by refference and once again monitoring the
      code quality. I also used imGUI to monitor certain statistics

    <p class="title">Scripting support</p>
    <p class="pc">
      In university I was tasked with adding Lua Scripting support to a space
      invaders clone made by the lecturer. In this project I implemented new
      variables such as an enemy counter, a player laser sprite variable to
      control the player's weapons and another sprite variable for the
      mothership. I also added a player lives variable and variables and
      functions to control the player's movement and combat. I also called
      multiple c++ functions inside of lua one of which being a function that
      allowed the changing of a start message for the game. Sadly there is no
      footage of theis due to technical dificulties and file managment issues
      and the only evidence I have isfor this is the git logs.
