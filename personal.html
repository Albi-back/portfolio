    <p class="single">
      This website was made by my willingness to learn new things so I looked up
      a tutorial online and read the documentation and began to learn how to use
      html,css and javascript. I then decided to transfer my portfolio over as
      it shows flexible work style and my willingness to learn new programming
      languages.

    <p class="single">
      At university I created an engine for the ps5 Dev kits as part of a module,
      and am currently working on a game inside my ps5 engine as part of a game studio project,
      I am working on a small horror game with some friends in which I am the lead design, 
      programmer, and level designer. NOTICE This work will be added as soon as it is completed
      and this page will be updated to include further projects.
